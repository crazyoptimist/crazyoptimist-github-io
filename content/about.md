### Bio

An engineer at heart, I enjoy trying different languages, frameworks and programming paradigms. I like making things work, then finding the faults in the system and repeating the process until it all ticks predictably.

I appreciate good design in all levels, from the smallest software module to the configuration of the company's procedures, team dynamics.

I love being around positive and driven people, optimistic atmosphere.
