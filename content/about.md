### Bio

&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a software engineer. My passion lies in hands-on software design and implementation. I seek to build software applications that both delights end users as well as the technical team that is to develop and operate the software. I strongly believe that software quality is key to delivering such delight, so I like to make sure that this is a key consideration in everything I do. I am a strong advocate for well tested code, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and team building. Happy to lead, happy to follow whatever it takes to get us there.


### Hard Skills

- Design and hands-on implementation of monolith, microservice, serverless applications at any scale
- TDD in Javascript/Typescript, Python, Go
- Smart contract development and private audit using Solidity, Hardhat, and Foundry
- Frontend development using React, Redux, Next.js
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform on multiple cloud platforms, including AWS and GCP
- Working with container technologies such as Docker, ECS, Kubernetes
- CI/CD with Github Actions, CircleCI, GitlabCI, Bitbucket and Jenkins
