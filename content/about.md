### Bio
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a software engineer with strong problem-solving capability and communication.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion lies in hands-on software design and implementation. I seek to build software applications that both delights end users as well as the technical team that is to develop and operate the software. I strongly believe that software quality is the key to delivering such delight, so I like to make sure that this is a key consideration in everything I do.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a strong advocate for well tested code, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and team building. Happy to lead, happy to follow whatever it takes to get us there.
