Firstly, install nginx on the server.

```bash
yum update
yum install epel-release
yum install nginx
```

Edit the nginx config file then.

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
vim nginx.conf
```

Edit the file like this:

```bash
server_name domain.com;
```

If you are not going to use a domain name, a public ip address would also work instead of `domain.com` ðŸ™‚
Find the location section in the file and replace it with:

```bash
location / {
  proxy_pass http://server_ip:8080;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

And that's it!

You can also add another app in the same nginx server block, for example, `location /app_name { â€¦ â€¦ }`, which means that the server relays from the route `/app_name`, and another port, of course.

Last but not least, donâ€™t forget to check the server's selinux settings.

```bash
getsebool -a
setsebool -P configuration_name on
```

Happy networking! ðŸ™‚
