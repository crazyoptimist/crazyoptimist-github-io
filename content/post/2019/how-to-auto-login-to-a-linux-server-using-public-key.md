This is a *manual* version of `ssh-copy-id` command.  
Letâ€™s say that we are logging in to server named B from a local machine named A.  
First off, generate authentication key pair without passphrase on the local machine A:  
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
Now you got a public key of your local machine, of which path is:
```bash
cd ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub
```
Grab the public key to append it to the serverâ€™s file named **authorized_keys**.  
If the file doesnâ€™t exist, create one on the server like so:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
touch authorized_keys
```
Congrats!  
Now you can login to the server B without any credentials from the local machine A.  
Happy networking! ðŸ˜Ž
