Today I am going to share you how to login to a cloud server without using password.  

Letâ€™s say there is a server and your local machine, assuming you can login to the server using some kind of credentials.  

First off, you should generate a new local public key on your local machine.  

Chdir to the current userâ€™s root directory.  

```bash
cd
ssh-keygen
```

If you see a prompt message of existing file, just overwrite it, give yes to every prompt otherwise.  

You can copy the generated public key to the server by this only one command ðŸ™‚

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@hostname
```

Use your existing credentials for prompts.  

If you see a message telling you to login to the server again, you are done. Pretty simple saving much time. ðŸ˜Ž
