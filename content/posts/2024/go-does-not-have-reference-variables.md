### What is a reference variable?

In languages like C++ you can declare an _alias_, or an alternate name to an existing variable. This is called a reference variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
        int a = 10;
        int &b = a;
        int &c = b;

        printf("%p %p %p\n", &a, &b, &c); // 0x7ffe114f0b14 0x7ffe114f0b14 0x7ffe114f0b14
        return 0;
}
```

You can see that a, b, and c all refer to the same memory location. A write to a will alter the contents of b and c. This is useful when you want to declare reference variables in different scopesâ€“namely function calls.

### Go does not have reference variables

Unlike C++, each variable defined in a Go program occupies a unique memory location.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        var a, b, c int
        fmt.Println(&a, &b, &c) // 0x1040a124 0x1040a128 0x1040a12c
}
```

It is NOT possible to create a Go program where two variables share the same storage location in memory. It is possible to create two variables whose contents point to the same storage location, but that is not the same thing as two variables who share the same storage location.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        var a int
        var b, c = &a, &a
        fmt.Println(b, c)   // 0x1040a124 0x1040a124
        fmt.Println(&b, &c) // 0x1040c108 0x1040c110
}
```

In this example, b and c hold the same value(the address of a), however, b and c themselves are stored in unique locations. Updating the contents of b would have no effect on c.

### There's no "reference type" in Go

What about struct and map and channel, they are reference types, no?

NOOOOO!

By the way, I'm not mentioning slice here because slice is a special data type associated with its "underlying array" in Go.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
        Age int
}

func modifyAge(p Person) {
        p.Age = 100
}

func main() {
        john := Person{
                Age: 50,
        }

        modifyAge(john)

        fmt.Println(john.Age == 100) // false
}
```

If the struct john was a C++ style reference variable, we should see `true` to be printed out. But it's not.

So, we can conclude that Go does not have _pass-by-reference_ semantics because Go does not have reference variables.

### Maps in structs

Well, how would you explain this example?

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
        Skills map[string]int
}

func modifySkills(p Person) {
        p.Skills["Writing"] = 6
}

func main() {
        john := Person{
                Skills: map[string]int{
                        "Making Mistakes": 10,
                },
        }

        modifySkills(john)

        fmt.Printf("%+v", john) // {Skills:map[Making Mistakes:10 Writing:6]}
}
```

> A map value is a pointer to a runtime.hmap structure.
> [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/30/if-a-map-isnt-a-reference-variable-what-is-it)

So, `john.Skills` holds the pointer to the content of the map variable, and thus, `modifySkills` function modifies the content of the `Skills` map variable.

The same holds true for nested maps, structs, and channels.

### What is a pointer in Go?

Off-topic, but not entirely.

This Gist explains it awesomely.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        i, j := 42, 2701
        fmt.Println(i, j)
        fmt.Println(&i, &j)

        // you can read "&i" as "address of i"
        p := &i
        // var p *int
        // here, p's type is "pointer pointing to integers"
        fmt.Printf("%T\n", p)
        // *p
        // here, * is an operator that returns what p is pointing to
        // it is also called "dereferencing"
        fmt.Println(*p)
        // changing value of *p will change the value of i
        *p = 21
        fmt.Println(i)

        p = &j
        *p = *p / 37
        fmt.Println(j)

        // this function call mutates the value of i
        squareVal(&i)
        fmt.Println(i)
}

func squareVal(p *int) {
        *p *= *p
        // so, return a pointer or a value? up to ya!
        // if you return a pointer, the Go garbage collector will have something more todo with the heap.
        // just focus on readibility for now
        // consider trade-offs when you optimize
        fmt.Println(p, *p)
}
```

Alright, that's it for now.

Happy coding, Gophers!
