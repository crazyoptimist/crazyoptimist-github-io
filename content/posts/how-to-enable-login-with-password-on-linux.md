Let’s update the Password Authentication parameter in the ssh service config file:
```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Hey, what? You can't even find the sshd service?  
Install it then:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
In the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, uncomment this line:
```bash
#PasswordAuthentication yes
```
Boom! Done.  

Oops! Don’t forget to reboot! 🙂  
Or just run:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
Happy networking!
