PM2 is a process manager for nodejs apps. It daemonizes apps built with nodejs, which means run-as-service.  
Letâ€™s install PM2 using npm.  
```bash
npm install -g pm2@latest
```
Now you can start your app using pm2 like so:
```bash
pm2 start app.js
```
Next, register the app as startup process.  
```bash
pm2 startup systemd
pm2 save
```
You can check the currently running apps like so:
```bash
pm2 list
```
Remember your app name or id so that you can use it to restart or stop the service.
```bash
pm2 restart
```
Simply hitting pm2 command will show you pm2 help.  
Happy coding! ðŸ™‚
