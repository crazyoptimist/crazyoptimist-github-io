As a software engineer or a DevOps engineer, you may come up with boring tasks frequently, one of which is setting up a new cloud environment for deployment of your awesome web apps/micro services.  
Using the following script, you will lose the dull pain. Just grab the script and run it with bash, then you will get the complete environment with docker/docker-compose and nginx which are all on the latest stable version.  
***
Note: This is just for Ubuntu Bionic/Focal. Bug me anytime in case you want to get the same one for any other distro, I'd love to help!
