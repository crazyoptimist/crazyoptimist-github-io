I strongly believe that "lazy developer" is a synonym of "talented developer" from a motivational point of view.  
Okay, let's get started with Jenkins setup then.  
{{< gist crazyoptimist e8836cee62dc52a05a94cbcbb6783a09 >}}
Let's go for  password login for deployment, remembering that it's not the only way nor an elegant way of implementation, but just follow up ;)  
### CHANGE SSH PORT - FOR DESTINATION SERVER
```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Find out the line `#port 22` and uncomment it to change into `port ${YOUR_NEW_SSH_PORT}`, then reload the sshd service like so:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
One more additional step for firewall (ufw in Ubuntu, firewall-cmd in CentOS), but we will refer to tons of materials out there, instead of mentioning it here.  
### ENABLE PASSWORD LOGIN FOR DESTINATION SERVER
In the same file as just above (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), do some modification like so:  
```
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin yes
```
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
### CREATE A PUBLIC KEY - FOR DESTINATION SERVER
```bash
ssh-keygen  # yes to all
cat /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Now you are seeing a public key of the destination server, which is called `Deploy Key` in **Settings** section on your github repo.  
I think you got some sense on how to use it now.  
### CREATE A JENKINS JOB
You need **SSH plugin** besides the preinstalled recommended plugins in your Jenkins plugin shed.  
Pretty straightforward hereafter, once you know shell script, you will get things done smoothly.  
### CONFIGURE GITHUB HOOK TRIGGER FOR GIT-SCM POLLING
Navigate to your github repo's **Settings** page, in the **Webhooks** tab, add in this url for **Payload URL**.  
```bash
$JENKINS_BASE_URL/github-webhook/
```
And set the payload type to `application/json`.  
Note that this is specific to **Github** plugin, which is automatically installed as a recommended one.

Now you have everything needed for setting up a CD pipeline using Jenkins basically.  
Feel free to ask any help in case you got stuck. ðŸ˜Ž  
Thanks for reading!
