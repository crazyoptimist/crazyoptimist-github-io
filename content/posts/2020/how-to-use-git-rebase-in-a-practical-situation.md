Letâ€™s say there are two pull requests open on a project repository.  
Each change has its own branch like this:  

- master
- feature/add-base64-endpoint
- feature/add-user-agent-endpoint

The challenge is to use git rebase to add both changes to master. When you finished, your master branch should have three commits in the following order:

>* feat: add user-agent endpoint
>* feat: add base64 endpoint
>* init

Okay, letâ€™s go!
```bash
git clone repo_url
git status
git checkout feature/add-base64-endpoint
git rebase master
git status
git checkout master
git merge feature/add-base64-endpoint
git status
git checkout feature/add-user-agent-endpoint
git rebase master
```
Oops! You should see `rebase conflict`!  
You need to check the code and fix it. Fortunately VS Code provides great hints for you to do that.  
Once you fix it, do like this:  
```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
git checkout master
git status
git checkout master
git merge feature/add-user-agent-endpoint
git status
git log
```
Boom! You must be done!  
Happy gitting! ğŸ˜‰
