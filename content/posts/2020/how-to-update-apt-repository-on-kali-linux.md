Back up the current sources.list first.  
```bash
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
```
Well, run this command then.
```bash
sudo echo "deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib" > /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Now you can run `apt update` command!  
Happy networking! 😎
