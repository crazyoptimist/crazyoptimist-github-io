Thanks to [Stan](https://github.com/angristan)'s great work, it became so delightful to run your own secure and stable private VPN server. It's never been so easy. 👍\
Download the installation script like this:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
```
Change file permission to executable like this:
```bash
chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
```
Boom! You did it!

### What is more ..
Wireguard is more advanced VPN protocol which brings us great stability, security and remarkable speed improvement.\
It's also available for one hit installation thanks to [Stan](https://github.com/angristan)!
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh
```
You may guess what you can do and which one you choose.\
Happy networking gents! 😎
