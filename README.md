### Thanks
Thanks to the author and all the contributors of [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme!

### How to bake the blog for production deploy
```bash
sh build.sh
```
Configure your nginx to serve static files in the **public** directory which is the build artifacts.  
That's it.
